    <h2>What You Need to Make Banana Pancakes</h2>
    <p>
      If you have ready-to-use bananas and a few kitchen staples, you already
      have everything you need to make perfect banana pancakes. Flour
      All-purpose flour contains gluten, a protein that gives the pancakes
      structure and pleasant chewiness. Sugar Granulated sugar adds sweetness,
      helps hold in moisture, and may create a tender texture. Baking Powder
      Baking powder is a leavener. It creates air bubbles in the batter, which
      ensures light and fluffy pancakes. Salt Salt adds subtle depth to all
      sorts of sweet dishes, including pancakes. You won't be able to detect it
      in the finished product, but you'll miss it if you leave it out. An Egg
      Eggs work with the other ingredients to bind and provide structure. The
      fatty yolks also add rich flavor and extra moisture. Milk Not only does
      milk add flavor, it is the liquid base that's essential for dissolving the
      dry ingredients and creating a cohesive batter. Vegetable Oil Vegetable
      oil is harder to burn than butter, so it's a great fat to use in banana
      pancakes. It keeps the pancakes moist and prevents them from sticking to
      the pan. Bananas Last but certainly not least, you'll need two mashed
      bananas for these pancakes. The bananas will help hold the other
      ingredients together and add mellow, fruity flavor.
